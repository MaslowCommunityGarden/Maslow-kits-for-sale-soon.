NOTE. We are in this project because we believe in to "make large technology available to anyone" and in the open source/makers movement.
The price of the latest Maslow kit with z-axis once sold by Bar Smith was **U$S 410 + shipping**, We are proud to be offering the same kit with even better electronics for **U$S 399 free shipping** in al USA (2-5 days delivery in USA, 6-10 worldwide) 

We are here to help and collaborate, we will not inflate the price including parts that you can make with the kit itself (wooden sled and brick straps), or bonuses that are actually FREE downloadable resources as Inkscape and sample projects.


We are committed to continue supplying quality kits and parts to the Maslow community.

![NOTE. The new shield v1.4 was a much needed upgrade to the kit, it was initially created by a community member @blurf to solve the problems of the shield v1.2 (burn out), and it is now produced by us with a few safety improvements. 
Support for this shield was also included in the original firmware since version 1.4 (more than a year ago). It is a Plug and Play shield made in USA that will not fail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaslowCommunityGarden/Maslow-kits-for-sale-soon./master/note.gif)
