**IMPORTANT NOTE TO NEW USERS**

**All kits to this day cut at the same speed and accuracy as the original, regardless of its vendor.**

The Maslow cnc project started its life after a successful KickStarter campaign.
Since then, three official versions of this kit were made by Barbour Smith (kit creator) before he decided to outsource the sales.

- v1 Original kit with two heavy L brackets (instead the ring system), and NO motorized/automated z-axis.
- v2 Option for a motorized/automated Z-axis was added.
- v3 Latest version with Ring system (instead L brackets), motorized/automated Z-axis.

(There is also a linkage kit version created by community members that replaces the ring system and seems to work as good as the original, however it is not nearly as widely used as the well proven ring system.)


The price of the latest Maslow kit with z-axis and ring system sold by Bar Smith after the kickstarter campaign was **U$S 410 + shipping**.

We are proud to be offering the complete kit with improved electronics for **U$S 429**, all without sacrificing quality.
