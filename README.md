![NOTE. The new shield v1.4 was a much needed upgrade to the kit, it was initially created by a community member @blurf to solve the problems of the shield v1.2 (burn out), and it is now produced by us with a few safety improvements. 
Support for this shield was also included in the original firmware since version 1.4 (more than a year ago). It is a Plug and Play shield made in USA that will not fail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaslowCommunityGarden/Maslow-kits-for-sale-soon./master/note.gif)
