**NOTE TO NEW USERS**, this project started its life after a successful KickStarter campaign.
Since then, three official versions of this kit have been introduced by Barbour Smith (creator) before he decided to reach out for third party kit suppliers.

- v1 Original kit with two heavy L brackets (instead the ring system), and NO motorized/automated z-axis.
- v2 Option for a motorized/automated Z-axis was added.
- v3 Latest version with Ring system (instead L brackets), motorized/automated Z-axis.

(There is also a version with trapezoidal linkage system created by community members that replaces the ring system and seems to work as good as the original, however it is not nearly as widely used as the well proven ring system created by Bar Smith.)


The price of the latest Maslow kit with z-axis and ring system sold by Bar Smith after the kickstarter campaign was **U$S 410 + shipping**.

We are proud to be offering the same complete kit with improved electronics for **U$S 399 free shipping**, all without sacrificing quality, we are still using the same manufacturers as Bar did and everyone else does with the exception of the improved shield and ring system which are made in USA. 

Our goal is to "Make Large cnc Technology Available to Anyone", we do not include parts that you can make with the kit itself (wooden sled and brick straps), or bonuses that are actually FREE downloadable resources as Inkscape and sample projects.

![NOTE. The new shield v1.4 was a much needed upgrade to the kit, it was initially created by a community member @blurf to solve the problems of the shield v1.2 (burn out), and it is now produced by us with a few safety improvements. 
Support for this shield was also included in the original firmware since version 1.4 (more than a year ago). It is a Plug and Play shield made in USA that will not fail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaslowCommunityGarden/Maslow-kits-for-sale-soon./master/note.gif)
