This is the latest and most up to date version of the Maslow kit that has been sold previously on this site by Bar Smith (original creator).

We are committed to continue supplying quality kits and parts to the Maslow community.

Our kit is the one sold by the thousands, it's not only a well proven and functional design but it also comes with the latest and all new shield version that won't let you down (TLE5206 v1.4) 

What **is** included:

- **Complete Kit**
- **Ring System**
- **All New Plug and Play Shield TLE5206 v1.4 made in USA** (originally designed by @blurfl to supersede the old v1.2)
- **Y / X / Z Original Etonm Motors**
- **Z-axis control**
- **All needed software for free**

- **6 Months Full Warranty on All Parts Including Shipping**

What is **not** included:

NOTE. We are in this project because we believe in to "make large technology available to anyone" and in the open source/makers movement.
The price of the latest Maslow kit with z-axis once sold by Bar Smith was **U$S 410 + shipping**, We are proud to be offering the same full kit with improved electronics for **U$S 399 free shipping** all without sacrificing quality, we are still using the same manufacturers as Bar did and everyone else uses with the exception of the improved shield and ring system which are made in USA.

We're not inflating the kit price including parts that you can make with the kit itself (wooden sled and brick straps), or bonuses that are actually FREE downloadable resources as INKSCAPE and sample projects.


There are 4 kit providers at the moment to choose from:
